## Metaverse

The word "metaverse" is made up of the prefix "meta" (meaning beyond) and the stem "verse" (a backformation from "[universe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universe)"); the term is typically used to describe the concept of a future iteration of the internet, made up of persistent, shared, 3D virtual spaces linked into a perceived virtual universe. It is a collective virtual shared space, created by the convergence of virtually enhanced physical reality and physically persistent virtual space, including the sum of all virtual worlds, augmented reality, and the Internet.
