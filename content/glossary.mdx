title: Roadmap

---
## Phase 1

In April 2021, we released our Cryptogogos NFTs on Ethereum. Considering the recent growth of Polygon (number of active developers, unique Polygon wallet address, NFT sale volume) and the nearly zero gas fees, we are transferring our collection onto Polygon on February 1st 2021. We continue to deliver the outstanding aesthetics of the CryptoGOGOs while enabling more use cases for our NFT holders.


## Phase 2

All CryptoGOGOs NFT holders will be able to enter our exclusive Discord channel, where we share alpha, latest development, regular games with exciting rewards and more.
Shortly after the sale, we will be launching our NFT staking function on GOGOcoin.io to boost yield on our USDC-GOGO farm. NFT staking on our single staking pools will follow later towards the end of February. The rarer the NFT you hold, the higher you APY boost powers.


## Phase 3

We will be intensively developing our DeFi product and adding more pools for farmers and stakers. You will be benefiting from your NFT utility on our DeFi protocol. NFT holders will benefit from the growth of our DeFi protocol and TVL.


## Phase 4

We will help our community of GOGOnauts expand the GOGO universe. This will be announced at upcoming ETH conferences, eg: ETH Denver, ETH hackathons, ETH Barcelona and more. The goal is to build a P2E game and eventually a CryptoGOGOs Metaverse!
