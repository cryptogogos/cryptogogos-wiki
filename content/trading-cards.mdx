Every CryptoGogos card has a unique monotonically increasing serial number that is assigned upon being minted. The earlier you acquire the card, the lower the number of the card. The cards will be numbered according to their tier.

## **Rarity-levels**

There are different probabilities of what card you will draw:

|Type of Card                     |Chance (in %)|Rarity-Level|Total Supply|
|---------------------------------|-------------|------------|------------|
|Silver                           |77.15        |common      |6000        |
|Gold                             |15.43        |rare        |1200        |
|Platinum                         |6.17         |super rare  |480         |
|Community (more to be announced) |1.25         |     -      |97          |


Cards are randomly allocated using [provable random data source](https://docs.provable.xyz/#security-deepdive-advanced-datasources-random-data-source), so authenticity verified using on-chain ledger proves. This ensures randomness used for card allocations and drawing and trading comes from a true secure ledger device.

## **Card tiers**

There are three main tiers of Crypto Gogos Cards :

1. Platinum Cards
2. Gold Cards
3. Silver Cards

In addition to these three tiers, there are also unique card tiers.

- Community Cards

What the community cards are about will be announced once Cryptogogos have taken over the NFT world ... stay tuned.
