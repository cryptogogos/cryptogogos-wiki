## **The GOGO bonding Curve**

The price for CryptoGogos cards starts at 0.05 ETH when the drawing period begins. As demand for the cards increases, the price of the cards will increase. The earlier you draw or trade for a card, the less you will pay.

Since price is dynamic based on the current supply, prices may fluctuate very quickly when demand is high. The price provided by **Metamask** when drawing or trading up may not be up to date. If another user draws a card using the same price, but with a higher gas price, their transaction may be processed first, voiding your price and causing your transaction to revert. To avoid this, we will be automatically spotting a slightly higher price than the current price when drawing and trading up to prevent collisions. Once the transaction is completed, the contract will automatically refund any excess ETH you overpaid.

Cards 1 to 3225 will cost between **0.05 ETH** and **0.15 ETH**. The price increases as each card is drawn. At the last 10% of the supply, the price will begin to increase sharply. At card 7151, the price will reach **1 ETH** per card.

The price is designed to increase because the remaining supply of cards becomes more predictable as each is drawn. Later users will know what cards have already been minted and therefore will have a better chance of estimating the probability of getting a specific and valuable card (ex. Platinum or Community card). Early adopters have less information and, therefore, more risk. They are rewarded by a lower price. In addition to a lower price, drawing early will increase early adopterâ€™s chances at trading up for a more valuable card. Total supply of CryptoGogos is fixed, so drawing early lets you trade up at a lower cost and acquire a more valuable CryptoGogos card.
