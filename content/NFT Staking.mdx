In order to combine the power of NFTs and DeFi, we have designed a cutting edge NFT staking function on GOGOcoin. Check out the boosts!

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>NFT Rarity</th>
    <th>APY Boost</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Silver</td>
    <td>10%</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Gold</td>
    <td>30%</td>
  </tr>
   <tr>
    <td>Platinum</td>
    <td>50%</td>
  </tr>
</table>

Here is a sneak peak of the NFT staking user-interface in the picture below. Please note that all the numbers and the boosting effects in the images are for showcasing reasons only.

There will be a “boost” button on each pool, when you enter the boosting interface seen in the picture above. All your CryptoGOGOs NFTs will be automatically displayed ranked from the highest rarity to the lowest. You will be able to see clearly how much each NFT will boost your APY.
