<ExpansionPanel title="How to get Crypto Gogos Cards?">

There are two options of getting to own a CryptoGogos Card: drawing and buying

#### **Draw**

The first way to get a card is by drawing. In the beginning, there are zero cards records. The first user to draw will trigger the mint function and the first card will be drawn.

The game begins by drawing cards. You can visit the Play page now to draw your card.

#### **Buying cards (not possible yet)**

To buy a card, visit the **Market** page and look at the cards available to buy. Click on **BUY** and complete the transaction to purchase the card. Once the purchase is successful, your new card will be available in the **My Gogos** sections.

To sell a card, click on the “Sell Your Gogos” section in the Market and set the price for the card you want to sell. Once the price is set, the card is immediately available for other users to purchase in the Market. The seller pays a 2% transaction fee to the contract for all sales through the Market. Since CryptoGogos are ERC-721 tokens, NFT marketplaces such as *[OpenSea](https://opensea.io/collection/)* are fully supported to sell your cards.

<ExpansionPanel title="Does my Wallet support NFT assets?">
Any actual ethereum wallet supports ERC-721 NFT assets like CryptoGogos. For example you can use a Metamask Wallet which can be directly connected to [cryptogogos.com](http://cryptogogos.com). Another very safe alternative would be trust wallet.

The reason why you should use a wallet like metamask or trust wallet is because you can't receive NFTs to a exchange wallet such as Coinbase. They are like a bank account; a platform which stores the value for you and offers transaction services. Furthermore, they run no other Crypto-Assets besides cryptocurrencies. Those are not actual ethereum wallets and won't recognise or accept any ethereum Asset like ERC-721 NFTs.

<ExpansionPanel title="How do I use Metamask?">
Please take a look into this Metamask-Guide: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1LrRBUMqip-N8z6Fvc9YEt9jTMeC_0RY5/view

<ExpansionPanel title="How do I know which CryptoGogo I am buying?">
    There is no way of  knowing. The CryptoGogo will first be revealed after it got minted. We feel it keeps some of the fun in the process to explore the project further after the reveal. Therefore, which CryptoGogo you will buy is up to chance. We want to keep the distribution of the different rarity levels as randomized as possible.

<ExpansionPanel title="Can I trade my CryptoGogos after the sale?">
    Yes, you can! CryptoGogos adhere to the ERC-721 standard, so they can be traded publicly on platforms such as opensea.io . Do make sure you're buying only CryptoGogos that are contained within the verified collection! These are the only verifiably legitimate CryptoGogos.

<ExpansionPanel title="What am I licensed to do with my CryptoGogos?">

You own your CryptoGogo digitally, but are free to do with them as you please. This includes, but is not limited to e.g. printing them for displaying them in the physical world. If you do decide to do something cool with it, don't hesitate to **reach out to us on Twitter** to show off your handywork!
