title: The GOGO Universe

## **Narrative**

In early 2021 the CryptoGOGO’s left their home on the Planet GOGO to become messengers of change for the crypto revolution on earth. They quickly rose to popularity with an awesome community of earthlings called GOGOnauts who loved the CryptoGOGOs playful personality and hi-res dope aesthetic. As gas fees on Ethereum went through the roof the CryptoGOGOs shied away and went into hiatus to formulate a new mission. They helped inspired the genesis of NFT/DeFi crossover GOGOcoin. GOGOcoin saw the chance to bring the two worlds of NFTs and DeFi together for the next generation of the crypto revolution. A revolution to make DeFi so easy your grandparents will be earning galactic yields! The CryptoGOGOs decided to find a new home on Polygon where they can move quickly and GOGOnauts don’t get burdened with high gas fees. Their new mission is to help GOGOnauts boost their token rewards on GOGOcoin and get galactic yields! 

The CryptoGOGOs have one wish, that the GOGOnaut community will help them build a glorious metaverse and P2E on Polygon where they can live freely while earning GOGOnauts rewards! This mission is yours should you choose to accept it! 

Planet GOGO houses four different CryptoGOGO-tribes:

PURPLE tribe
GREEN tribe
RED tribe
ORANGE tribe

Each CryptoGOGOs is allocated to one of the four tribes, no matter their rarity-level. Each tribe comes with a special storyline in the future development.
