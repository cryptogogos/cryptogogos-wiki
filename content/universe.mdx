## **Narrative**

In 2021 the world became like in 1984. The human race got enslaved to nonsense NFT Art and bad Collectibles. Ugly Kitties and terrible Punks mesmerized humankind and stole their money. Seeking revenge for the unjust treatment of the true meaning of NFTs, the CryptoGOGOs are coming the far way from PLANET GOGO in the Metaverse to start a revolution.

Alongside the GOGO-Rebellion (CryptoGOGO-Collectors), they bring back freedom and power to humankind by taking over the NFT WORLD.

CryptoGOGOs are coming with a clear Statement:“Every NFT you saw before is bullshit, we are the truth”

“Disrupt the Status Quo & Hail the CryptoGOGOs”

## **Background-Story**

The CryptoGOGO´s originate from Planet GOGO, a place somewhere in the Meta-Galaxy. They are inspired by “Gogo Crazy Bones” -  tiny, colorful characters that all of us played and traded on school yards around the world.

CryptoGOGO´s will come in hundreds of designs and colors.

### **Planet GOGO**

Somewhere in the Metaverse the Planet GOGO is home to the Cryptogogos. The Planet is inherited by five different tribes. Each of the tribe is located on another continent on Planet GOGO.

### **Spaceships**

On their mission of saving humankind and taking over the NFT world, the CryptoGogos are on the way to planet earth.  Each tribe comes with one special spaceship. They have the color of the tribe and will be minted as unique trading cards. There will be four spaceships, one allocated to each tribe.

### **CryptoGogos**

Somewhere in the Metaverse on a place called Planet GOGO, there are living 4 tribes of creatures on a special mission … the cryptogogos

### Tribes

Planet GOGO houses four different CryptoGOGO-tribes:

- Purple tribe
- PINK tribe
- RED tribe
- ORANGE tribe

Each CryptoGOGO is allocated to one of the four Teams, no matter their rarity-level. Each tribe comes with one spaceship.

The image of every card is also hosted on IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) which is a decentralized hypermedia protocol for sharing and storing data over a distributed network. This guarantees that the card will exist forever.
